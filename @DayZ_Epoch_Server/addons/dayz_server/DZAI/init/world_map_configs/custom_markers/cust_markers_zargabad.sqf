/*
	Custom Marker Requirements:
	
	1. Marker shape must be Ellipse (Could be rectangular but the function will consider the marker as elliptical regardless)
	2. Marker should have identical x and y dimensions. If they are different, the smaller dimension will be used instead.
		
	The area covered by the marker will be used as the patrol and spawning area.
	
	Example Marker (Note: the marker name must be unique! In this example, it's named "dzaicustomspawntest"):
	
	_this = createMarker ["dzaicustomspawntest", [6650.9883, 9411.541, -6.1035156e-005]];
	_this setMarkerShape "ELLIPSE";
	_this setMarkerType "Empty";
	_this setMarkerBrush "Solid";
	_this setMarkerSize [200, 200];
	_this setMarkerAlpha 0;

	Note: This marker will be used in the example further below.
